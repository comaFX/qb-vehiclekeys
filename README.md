# qb-vehiclekeys #
Modified [Vehicle Keys System For QB-Core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-vehiclekeys) utilizing [PS-UI](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-ui) from [Project Sloth](https://github.com/Project-Sloth) for lockpick mini-game.

Added the option to only allow the basic lockpick to work on certain cars. See config.lua > Config.UseDiffLockpicks and Config.BasicLockpickVehicles.
