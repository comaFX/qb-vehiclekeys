### :clipboard: Config Options ###

* Config.UseDiffLockpicks - if set to true, vehicles not included in Config.BasicLockpickVehicles will require an advanced lockpick.

* Config.VehiclesNoLockpick - if set to true, parked vehicles in Config.NoLockpickVehicles can be broken into without using a lockpick. (You're still required to hotwire the vehicle with a lockpick or "search for keys" if searching is not disabled)

* Config.DisableSearchForKeys - If set to true, the abilty to search for keys will be removed.
