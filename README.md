### :clipboard: Config Options ###

* Config.UseDiffLockpicks - if set to true, vehicles not included in Config.BasicLockpickVehicles will require an advanced lockpick.

* Config.VehiclesNoLockpick - if set to true, parked vehicles in Config.NoLockpickVehicles can be broken into without using a lockpick. (You're still required to "search for keys" or hotwire the vehcile)
